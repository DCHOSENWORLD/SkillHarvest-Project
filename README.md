### Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing inventory sales data for SkillHarvest, with the objective of uncovering insights into revenue generation across various regions and markets. The analysis includes steps such as data cleaning, transformation, pivoting, and visualization to highlight trends in regional sales performance and revenue growth.

### Key Objectives

### Process Overview

1. Data Cleaning:  
   The raw dataset was examined for any missing or inaccurate values. Duplicates were removed, and inconsistencies in data formatting were corrected to ensure data quality.

   After cleaning, the data was transformed for deeper analysis. This included creating new columns, such as total revenue per region and market. This transformation step helped in structuring the data for visualization and deeper insights.

3. Pivoting:  
   Pivot tables were used to summarize data across multiple dimensions like regions and markets. The aim was to display aggregated revenue values that could be filtered by region and market performance, helping identify key trends and patterns.

4. Visualization:
