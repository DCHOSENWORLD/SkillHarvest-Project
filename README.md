#  Nigeria Inventory Sales

### Project Overview
The "Nigeria Inventory Sales" project aims to provide insights into sales performance, inventory management, and market trends within the Nigerian context.

### Key Insights

1. Sales Performance Trends:
   - Analyze monthly or quarterly sales data to identify peak sales periods. This can help understand seasonal demand patterns and adjust inventory accordingly.

2. Inventory Turnover:
   - Assess how quickly inventory is sold and replaced. A high turnover rate may indicate strong sales performance, while a low rate could suggest overstocking or weak demand.

3. Product Performance:
   - Identify which products are top performers and which ones are lagging. This helps in making informed decisions about restocking, discontinuing, or promoting specific items.

4. Sales by Region:
   - Examine how sales differ across various regions in Nigeria. This can help identify potential markets for expansion or targeted marketing efforts.
